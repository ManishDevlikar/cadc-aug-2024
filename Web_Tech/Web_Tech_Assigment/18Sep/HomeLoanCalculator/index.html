        Formula for EMI Calculation is -

        P x R x (1+R)^N / [(1+R)^N-1] where-

        P = Principal loan amount

        N = Loan tenure in months

        R = Monthly interest rate

        The rate of interest (R) on your loan is calculated per month.

        R = Annual Rate of interest/12/100

        If rate of interest is 7.2% p.a. then r = 7.2/12/100 = 0.006

        For example, If a person avails a loan of ₹10,00,000 at an annual interest rate of 7.2% for a tenure of 120 months (10 years), then his EMI will be calculated as under:

        EMI= ₹10,00,000 * 0.006 * (1 + 0.006)120 / ((1 + 0.006)120 - 1) = ₹11,714.
